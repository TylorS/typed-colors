# Typed Colors

> ANSI Color Code helpers

A small set of well-typed, in TypeScript, functions to add color to your node.js
applications.

This is an extremely simple codebase, and it documents itself, please see the
source code to see what available colors and modifiers there are.

```TypeScript
import { cyan } from 'typed-colors';

console.log(cyan('Hello, world!'));
```
